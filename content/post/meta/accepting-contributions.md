**Note:** this is very early days for the project, and this section will change
as I figure things out. Please check back later if you're curious.

I've given a talk titled [Working Distributed - How Does It Even Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjilQkxUW8g)
a few times, based on my first few years working remotely for GitHub, but after
taking a break from the conference circuit a couple of years ago I recently
found myself looking to update this talk as I felt I had more to share.

Rather than updating the talk or creating a new talk I chose to flesh out the
content as a website, as it enables me to do a bunch of things that weren't
previously possible, including:

- go into detail on topics without needing to meet time constraints
- touch on areas relevent to different audiences, rather than needing to focus
- incorporate the insights and experiences of others, to build a more
  well-rounded source of information

I know I'm not the only one with experience and insights about the topic of
distributed teams and working remotely, so I wanted to set out in detail where I
think this could head and how you can get involved.

## Small edits

If you find something on the site that could be improved - to address a typo or
a gramatically error - I'd happily accept an [open issue](https://github.com/shiftkey/workingdistributed.com/issues/new?template=problem-with-content.md) to track the problem. If you have a
GitHub account I plan to make it easy to jump straight from any page to the
source site in the repository to make edits, but that's not implemented yet -
see [issue #13](https://github.com/shiftkey/workingdistributed.com/issues/13)
for more details on this.

Anyone who submits a typo fix or pull request that gets merged will get an
acknowledgement on the site, as well as in any further outputs spun out from
this work (for example, a friend was suggesting that I could turn this into a
book).

For the moment I'll track this in the front matter for each file, like this:

```yaml
---
title: Accepting Contributions
contributors:
  - Your Name Here <name@example.com>
---

```

I've included an email address for contributor entry to cover me for the
unlikely event that I need to contact you in the future about how contributions
are managed, but if you prefer to not be contacted this can be omitted from the
repository.

I haven't yet figured out how to present this list on the site, but once I'm
happy with the layouts for the content this will likely become clearer to me.

## Articles or other significant contributions

I'd love to be able to incorporate significant contributions from other people
as part of this project, but I want to ensure that I handle contributions in an
appropriate way.

If there are any profits from this project, I'll likely donate them to a

section as things become clearer so that contributors are aware of what's
involved.
