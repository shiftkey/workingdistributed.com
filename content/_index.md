This is the start of the thoughts, opinions and ideas I have around distributed
workers and teams. Expect the content to change as I iterate on the format and
expand on the content.

## Content

More will appear here as I have time and the urge to write about them.

- [What are distributed teams?](/what-are-distributed-teams/)

## Context

These links are resources about the project itself, to go with the content
related to the project:

- [Genesis and Direction](/genesis-and-direction/)
- [Accepting contributions](/accepting-contributions/)

## Questions

#### I want to help out!

Please [read this guide](/accepting-contributions/) which outlines what I'm
currently looking for and how I plan to handle contributions from others as part
of this project.

If this still interests you, please [fill out the issue template](https://github.com/shiftkey/workingdistributed.com/issues/new?template=potential-contribution.md)
